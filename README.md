# The Remax Website project aims to create an easy-to-use platform for users who want to find properties and connect 
with real estate agents. This platform provides property listings and allows users to communicate directly with agents 
to get more information or schedule property viewings.

## Features
- Property Search: Users can search for properties based on various criteria such as location, property type, price range, and more.
- Agent Profiles: Each real estate agent has a profile that showcases their experience, expertise, and contact information.
- Direct Communication: Users can send messages to agents directly through the platform, streamlining the communication process.
